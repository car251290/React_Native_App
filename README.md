React_Native_ App


React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. It’s views all the way down!

React Native Lifecycle

They are born (creation), grow (updating), and finally, die (deletion). This is called the component lifecycle. For each phase of a component's life, React Native provides access to certain built-in events/methods called lifecycle hooks or methods.
